This code creates a basic tic-tac-toe game using Python. The game is played on a board of size 3x3, and players take turns marking spaces with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The game ends when one player wins or there are no more empty spaces left.

The code starts by defining the function `drawboard`, which takes in the current state of the board as a parameter. It then prints out the current state of the board using the `print` statement.

Next, the code defines the function `player_move`, which takes in the current state of the board and the current player's turn as parameters. This function prompts the player to enter a move (a number from 1 to 9), checks if the entered move is valid (i.e., within the bounds of the board), and updates the board with the player's mark ('X' or 'O') in that space.

The code also defines the function `check_win`, which takes in the current state of the board as a parameter and checks if either player has won. This function first checks rows, then columns, and finally diagonals for three in a row of the same mark ('X' or 'O'). If either player wins, the function returns `True`. If neither player has won, the function returns `False`.     

The main game logic is implemented in a loop that iterates until one player wins or there are no more empty spaces left. The loop first initializes the board with empty spaces, sets the current player's turn to 1 (for player 1), and calls the `drawboard` function to print out the initial state of the board.

The game then continues by calling the `player_move` function in a loop that iterates until one player wins or there are no more empty spaces left. The `turn` variable is used to keep track of which player's turn it is, and the `drawboard` function is called after each move to update the board and show the current state to the players.

Finally, the loop checks if either player has won or there are no more empty spaces left. If one player wins, the winner is printed out and the game ends. If it's a tie (i.e., neither player has won), the message "It was a tie" is printed out and the game ends.

 It seems that there was an error in the code. In the first line of the code, the string `[PYTHON]` was enclosed within quotes ("), which means Python sees it as a string and not as code to be executed. To fix this issue, we can remove the quotes around `[PYTHON]`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
